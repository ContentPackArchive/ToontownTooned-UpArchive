Dear whoever this may concern,
	This is a resource pack made up of textures by me and textures from the Toontown Upscaled Pack. I know these textures are not mine and I give all credit of these textures to cnnoi33.
To install:
Extract Zip (You should’ve done that already)
Copy phase_X.mf files
Paste files in ToontownRewritten\resources (this is in the folder you installed it in, but most likely C:\Program Files (x86)\Toontown Rewritten)
Run Toontown Rewritten and have fun!

Sincerely,
ApertureSquirrel
